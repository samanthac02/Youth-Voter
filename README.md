## 🗳️ Youth Voter · *Congressional App Challenge – 2nd Place*

In the 2020 election, only **50% of eligible youth voters** cast ballots—despite it being the highest rate of youth participation ever recorded. According to CIRCLE at Tufts University, youth voter turnout was **17 percentage points lower** than the general turnout. In their book *Making Young Voters*, John Holbein and D. Sunshine Hillygus attribute this gap to three core barriers: lack of information, limited political interest, and difficulty registering.

These barriers inspired me to create **Youth Voter**—an app that lowers the threshold for young people to get involved in elections.

### 👋 Meet the Developer

Hi! I’m **Samantha Chang**, the developer of Youth Voter. My app aims to:

- Encourage youth voting and political engagement  
- Provide tools to **register to vote**  
- Display personalized information on **local representatives**

---

### 🧠 Voting Education

The **Voting** page begins with the question: *“Why vote?”* Many young people believe their vote doesn’t matter, so I built this page to challenge that idea with data.

For example, based on research from *The Civics Center*, the number of new 18-year-olds by the 2024 election in the ten most decisive states **triples** the previous voting margins in those same states. Infographics on youth voting potential and past election margins show users the **real impact** their vote can make.

### 🗺️ Registering to Vote

The **Register** page uses Apple’s **CoreLocation** and **MapKit** frameworks to determine the user’s location and display it on a map.

- The **“Register Now”** button redirects users to [Vote.org](https://vote.org)  
- A graphic of **state-specific voting requirements** helps users prepare their documentation  
- A button connects users directly to a **voter helpline**

---

### 📣 Engagement Tools

The **Engagement** page encourages users to:

- Start voter registration drives via [The Civics Center](https://thecivicscenter.org)  
- Share the app on social platforms  
- Donate to youth voting efforts  
- View and explore **source materials** used in the app

Spreading awareness—even to one person—can make a big difference.

### 🏛️ Representative Lookup

On the **Representatives** page, the app uses Google’s **Civic Information API** to display local House and Senate representatives based on the user’s location. Each profile includes:

- Name & photo  
- Title & chamber  
- Phone number  
- Website  
- Twitter handle  

All data is parsed from a JSON response and dynamically displayed.

### 🎯 Why I Built Youth Voter

I built **Youth Voter** to break down the barriers that keep young people from participating in democracy. By combining voting education, registration tools, and political engagement features in one app, I hope to **increase youth voter turnout** and give my generation a louder voice.

You can download the app by searching **“YouthVoter”** on the Apple App Store.

Let’s make 2024 the year youth turnout breaks records.  
Thank you for reading!
